# Decisions

Why MyPaddie is built the way it is. One entry per non-obvious call: what was
chosen, what else was on the table, and why.

## 2026-10-05 — Day 1 (engine)

### One Next.js app, feature-based folders
`src/features/{xp,mode,money}` hold logic, types and tests together; `src/shared`
holds the vocabulary, config and time helpers. Next.js is scaffolded now (UI comes
Day 3) so the engine is written in its permanent home. Day 2's MCP server can be
a route handler in the same app — one deploy instead of two.
Rule: `src/features/*` never imports Next.js or Supabase. Each feature is plain
data in, plain data out.

### The engine never reads the clock
Every function takes `now`. That makes "late", "ignored", "the last 7 days" and
"day 31 of the audit" testable with fixed dates, and means the engine behaves
identically whether called from the MCP server, the PWA or a cron job.

### Bun for packages and tests
`bun test` is built in and Jest-compatible, so no test framework dependency.
Considered Vitest (the original default); dropped once Bun was chosen.

### Days are Africa/Lagos calendar days
"Ignored", streak windows and the audit clock all count local calendar days,
not 24-hour blocks or UTC days. A need due at 07:00 isn't "ignored" until its
local day has fully ended — there's the rest of the day to recover.

### XP: integers, split by largest remainder
XP is whole numbers. Splitting 10 XP 34/33/33 gives 4/3/3 — the leftover point
goes to the largest fractional remainder (ties: larger weight, then pillar order).
Parts always sum to the total; nothing is lost or invented to rounding.

### XP rules (defaults, all in `src/shared/config.ts`)
- Late (done after `due_at`) pays 50%, however late. Rewards never round to 0.
- Ignored need deducts 50% of base XP, split by the same weights.
- A need is protected from the deduction by an **accepted** slip. `slips.accepted`
  has no default so the caller must decide.
- Only needs can deduct. Wants, goals, wishes, dreams and loose chores never do.
- Goal completion 2×, dream milestone 3×, wish happening +50 flat.
- Logging any transaction: +2 Financial, no matter what was bought.

### Who decides a slip's reason is valid: Paddie, with a repeat-rule backstop
Options were (a) the AI judges, (b) a fixed rule, (c) both. Chose (c).
`judgeSlip` lets Paddie judge first; then the 3rd time the same reason is given
for the same habit within 7 days, it's an excuse regardless. The rule can only
turn a yes into a no. "Same reason" compares Paddie's short `why_category` when
both slips have one, else normalised text (case, punctuation and spacing ignored)
— exact text alone would miss "tired" vs "I was tired.".
Why both: an AI can be talked round by a good story; a counter can't, but a
counter alone can't tell a real emergency from a lazy morning.

### Mode precedence
Override > low-HP day (soft) > repeated slip or 3+ ignored needs in 3 days
(strict) > curious. A rough day beats repeated slips because rough isn't
slacking. "Go easy on me" expires at local midnight; "no mercy" lasts until
switched off. `computeMode` returns the *reasons* as well as the mode so the AI
picks its tone from facts.
"Same slip" means the same recurring item (Rhapsody every day is many task rows
but one habit), falling back to the task id.

### Money stage uses fixed 30-day periods, not a rolling window
First tried a rolling "last 30 days" window. A test caught that a monthly
salary slides out of a rolling window and the stage would flip deficit/surplus
from one day to the next. Now: periods counted from the first logged
transaction (period 1 = audit), and the stage comes from the last *complete*
period. It holds for 30 days at a time, and the first verdict after the audit
equals what the audit measured.
Also: "unsure" counts as a need (overestimating needs is the safer mistake), and
needs exactly equal to income is surplus.

### Deficit: fund floors first, then comfort
Pass 1 funds each need's floor in priority order; pass 2 tops up to comfortable.
Everything important gets its cheapest honest version before anything gets
comfort. Reports `gap` (comfortable), `floorGap` and `hiddenWants`.

### Money is bigint whole naira
No floats anywhere near money. Kobo was considered and skipped: nothing in a
personal budget needs it.

### Database invariants live in the database
- Composite `(id, user_id)` foreign keys: a row can only point at a parent owned
  by the same user, even if someone guesses an id. Plain RLS doesn't stop that,
  because FK checks bypass RLS.
- Weights sum to 100 via a *deferred* constraint trigger, checked at commit so
  three inserts in one transaction can build up to 100.
- `xp_log` is an append-only ledger (select + insert only). `pillars.xp` is
  derived from it by trigger and is read-only to clients, so totals can't drift.
- Partial unique indexes make XP idempotent: a retried completion can't pay twice.
- Explicit grants to `authenticated` only, nothing to `anon`. Supabase stops
  auto-exposing new tables to the Data API from 2026-10-30.

### Added to the blueprint schema
`tasks.base_xp`, `tasks.title`, `items.priority`, `items.floor_amount` /
`comfortable_amount`, `slips.accepted`, `xp_log.item_id`, and a `checkins` table
(daily energy 1–5) because soft mode needs mood data the blueprint didn't store.
